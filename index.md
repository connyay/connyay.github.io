# Hi! I'm Connor.
I am a software engineer working at [Red Hat](http://redhat.com) in Raleigh, NC.  
I graduated from [Northern Illinois University](http://www.cs.niu.edu/) in May 2013.  
I am currently focusing on front-end development, but I have experience and interest in mobile and back-end development.
